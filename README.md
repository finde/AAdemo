## AA lab

How to run:
- open the index.html with a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari).
- set the world size
- set predator init location
- set prey init location
- click 'start'
- wait until the loading is done.

After planning is done, the buttons below will be active:
- 'Test Result' to see the report of each scenario (based on assignment instruction)
- 'Policy Evaluation' to see the value of current state (based on Reduced-State-Space)
- 'Policy Iteration' to see the policy of each grid relative to prey location based on Policy Iteration algorithm.
- 'Value Iteration' to see the policy of each grid relative to prey location based on Value Iteration algorithm.
- 'Play' button to run the simulator.
- 'Step-Forward' button to play only once step ahead.

Have fun playing around with the simulator.

Note: If you change the initial settings (world size, predator location, or prey location), you need to click the 'start' button again. Otherwise the simulator is not recreated.
